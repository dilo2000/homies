### Web Learning
Web development is very new territory for me coming from a mechatronics background. I was intrigued by the endless ways web development can be applied which led me to beginning a number of projects. This repository contains different web development projects to aid learning.

#### Homies
The idea for this project was to create a platform for my close friends to share photos on. Each photo that is taken on the website is posted on the front page in a grid format for everyone to see. It forms a collection of images over time that encapsulates your connection. 


#### Visualiser
This project was developed to experiment with the js library p5.js. The website currently forms an overlapping visual that is based on the properties of perlin noise. 

#### project1
This project was created to experiment with SVG files. I wanted to create different shapes, curves and lines, and then see how these could be used with css for styling and graphic design.
